# Refactor-VBA-Code
Refactoring VBA Code for Green Stocks analysis

**Project Background**

The purpose of this stock analysis is helping client obtain and compare Total Daily Volume and Yearly Return of all stocks in particular year. 
The VBA code provides essentially infnite extensibility to Excel and using code to automate tasks decreases the chance of errors and reduces
the time needed to run analyses, especially if they need to be done repeatedly.
Refactor project will provide the solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in other module.
Finally, we determined whether the refactoring code successfully made the VBA script run faster.


## Conclusion
In 2018, only *ENPH* and *RUN* two stocks had positive yearly Return as well as large Total Daily Volume. Both of them was outperformance than others green stocks.
